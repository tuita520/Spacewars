To use this solution, set both the ClientView and Server to be startup projects and change the XML properties (in the SpaceWars project) to affect in-game settings. In order to play the extra game mode, make sure to enter EXTRA in all caps in the XML property called GAMEMODE in the gamesettings xml file. Controls are: "F" for fire, up arrow for thrust, and left/right arrows for turning.

The extra mode has 3 extra features, see if you can figure them out!(pretty easy)


This is a class project in which we were first given a server.exe and told to make a client that met the specifications. Then guess what? We had to make a server too! We had a lot more wiggle room in the creativity department for the server. I really enjoyed making this modular, it's surprising how much can be done without changing the client. Too many ideas and not enough time to implement them all!
